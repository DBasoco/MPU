# Magic: The Gathering CPU: dubbed a MPU

# Required skills OOP: needs to __init__ cards(), to save time GUI: the users on the website need to navigate
# comfortably Files: import image files and the paper Magic: The Gathering Is Turing Complete A full sim game needs
# to be run. For this opponent cards before forced state can be arbitrary and fixed. Also the game should give you
# tips as you play

# Layout:
# Homepage {
# Welcome & description
# {MPU: Play}
# {Paper}
# {Contact}
# }

# Optional:
# Games played counter
# Security: not required but helpful



# project burn down
# estimated 3-5 months
# 1-5 hours a day
# total coding time should be 450 hours
# 30 lines an hour
# will be 2000 lines, this is very much on the high end in my view at this time

## indicates it is being worked on
### indicates it is finished

        ## combat
        # again
        # end
## define each card (this and the GUI should take the longest amount of time)
## develop GUI (either here or in the next stage is when I will add the guided assistant for players)
# create website
# finished
# add counter
# add security
