Step-by-step running of a turing complete game of Magic: The Gathering.

So, in 2019 a group of researchers discovered that the card game Magic: The Gathering(MTG) was so complex with it's 20,000+ cards and complex interactions that it could be considered "Turing Complete". This means that not only is MTG the hardest game to play(and play well), but that it can also act as a computer. In the paper, the researchers created a deck that when executed turns the game into a computer. The issue is that following each step in real play is incredibly difficult and the deck has a hefty price tag. 

To overcome this I've decided to code a virtual game of MTG that gives steps to follow as you play. This will make executing the machine far easier and circumvents the need to buy the real deck. Of course, servers to run MTG already exist, the difference being is that this one has the added feature of walking you through which cards to play and when so that you can make an analog computer on your digital computer. 

The server will also have the original paper uploaded for pursusal. 

This is also an exploration into object-oriented programming, Git sharing, and possibly server architecture once the server is created. Please enjoy going over the code. I hope to have a functioning game/server in 3/5 months. 

The Main file holds the progress of the project and will track updates.

The Cards file holds the card types that can be played.

The Phase file holds how the game progresses with players, turns, and the stack.

The Init file holds all the cards that you need in your deck.

The Test file holds what I'm currently testing and working on before I commit it to the proper file.

The pdf is the full paper that I am working off of for this project.
